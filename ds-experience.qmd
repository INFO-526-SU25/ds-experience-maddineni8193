## Part 1: Experience data science outside of the classroom {#part-1-experience-data-science-outside-of-the-classroom}

Give the information for the experience. 

Category Chosen: Talk with a data scientist (Graduate student pursuing a Master’s in Data Science)
Name of the person: Rishabh Bhattad
Date of Activity: June 24, 2025
Duration: 1 hour

Description of the Activity
For this experience, I had the opportunity to talk with my senior, Rishabh Bhattad, who is currently pursuing a Master’s degree in Data Science at the University of Arizona. He recently completed a project for the course Data Visualization and Analysis (INFO 526), where he explored global renewable energy growth, with a specific focus on solar energy trends across different countries.

Rishabh Bhattad explained how their project combined multiple real world datasets from trusted sources, including the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), the World Bank, and Solargis. The project aimed to analyze how solar energy capacity has changed globally from the year 2000 to 2024 and to highlight regions with strong solar potential that have yet to be fully utilized.

To analyze and communicate these insights effectively, Rishabh Bhattad and his team used several tools from the data science field, such as R, ggplot2, plotly, and dplyr. These tools helped them clean the data, perform analysis, and create clear and visually engaging visualizations that made it easy to understand complex global trends.

One of the most impressive aspects of their project was the development of an interactive 3D globe using Globe.gl, along with Shiny and HTMLWidgets. This interactive globe allowed users to visually explore how solar energy capacity has grown in different countries and regions, compare solar potential across the world, and gain insights into renewable energy expansion. The project also included options for filtering by region and solar technology, which made it more engaging and user friendly.

Rishabh Bhattad also shared how the project involved several technical challenges, such as merging large datasets from multiple sources, dealing with missing or inconsistent data, and integrating different technologies like R and JavaScript to make the final application interactive and accessible. Despite these challenges, they successfully developed a functional and informative platform that made exploring renewable energy data intuitive for users.

This experience connects directly to the concepts we are learning in class. In my Data Analysis and Visualization course, we work with tools like ggplot2 to create meaningful visualizations, and Rishabh Bhattad project demonstrated how those same skills can be applied to real world projects that have global significance. It also showed me how important it is to combine technical knowledge with effective storytelling to communicate complex information clearly.




## Part 2: Summarize your experience {#part-2-summarize-your-experience}

Summary: 

Talking with Rishabh Bhattad gave me a valuable opportunity to see how data science is applied beyond classroom learning. His project on global renewable energy, especially focusing on solar energy trends, showed me how the tools and techniques we practice in class can be used to work on large-scale, real-world problems that have global significance.

One of the things that impressed me the most was how Rishabh Bhattad and his team combined technical skills with effective storytelling. They didn’t just create charts and graphs, they built an interactive 3D globe that allows users to explore energy data by country and region. This made me realize that data science is not just about analysis, but also about designing engaging, user friendly ways for people to understand complex information.

I also learned how important it is to work with reliable, real world datasets and how that can bring its own set of challenges. Rishabh Bhattad explained how they had to clean and merge large datasets from sources like IRENA, the World Bank, and Solargis. He shared that dealing with missing values, inconsistent formats, and integrating different technologies like R and JavaScript were some of the biggest hurdles in their project. This made me appreciate the importance of attention to detail and problem solving in data science projects.

What really stood out to me was how their project made renewable energy data accessible to a wide audience. The interactive visualizations, filtering options, and clean design encouraged people to explore the data themselves. I realized that making data engaging and easy to interpret is just as important as doing the analysis itself, especially when working with topics like global sustainability and renewable energy.

Overall, this experience inspired me to explore more about interactive visualizations and tools like Shiny and Globe.gl. It also showed me that being a successful data scientist means not only having technical knowledge but also knowing how to communicate results clearly and make them interesting for others. I feel more motivated to apply these lessons to my own coursework and future projects.
